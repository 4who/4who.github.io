## Welcome to 4who
<!-- ![/statics/cover.png](/statics/cover.png) -->
4Who helps gets funding into the hands of people affected with humanitarian crises.
By leveraging the power of e-payment, we can ensure that the funds reach to their beneficiaries in a safe, fair and secure way.
We empower organizations and communities to respond and work collaboratively by providing the tools and resources to do so.

## What do we do
## State of refugees in Sudan
- there are ever growing number of refugees in Sudan (900K from South Sudan only!) [UNHCR](http://reporting.unhcr.org/sudan)
- the economic crisis resulted in shortage in food (esp. bread)
- organizations already have access to refugees; the problem is the fair distribution of the financial aid!

## 4Who
Our project is very simple, provide an easy secure and reliable way to deliver aid to its beneficiaries. 

### Challenges
- NGOs and governmental organizations face difficulties into getting their aid to their beneficiaries
- lots of logistics and fraud in the middle

### What we want
- the aid should *only* be spent on food 
- send money regularly to the beneficiaries
- ensure that the money is *well* spent
- help build the local communities by creating new small businesses

## 4Who
- Using cash cards (prepaid cards) for beneficiaries (their aid will be sent to it)
- 4Who can help you meet your organizationl targets
- We provide the necessary tooling to securely and reliably deliver aid
- Reports to track down the expenses and perform extra analysis

By providing financial cards (that are locked only to work through our affiliated merchants), we can ensure that we have a reliable, secure financial aid delievery system that is aligned with the financial inclusion goals.

## Successful stories
A simialr system was tested on Syrain refugees in both Lebanon and Jordan. You can find more about the story [here](https://newsroom.mastercard.com/press-releases/wfp-launches-e-cards-for-syrian-refugees-in-lebanon-with-mastercards-support/).
We believe, we can be a great technical partner for WFP and similar UN and local organizations to apply this experience in Sudan.
